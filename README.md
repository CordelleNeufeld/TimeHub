# TimeHub
Timekeeping for personal and collaborative projects.

The focus for this app is tracking one-time, singular occurrences of completed tasks in order to calculate statistics for cumulative hours of tasks within different user-defined projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is necessary for the user to have access to a database with an SQL relational database management system like MariaDB.

The user is required to enter data into the following fields in order to login:

* Database Host (e.g., php.scweb.ca)
* Database Codename
* Database User
* Database Password

This information can be reset from the File menu item: Change Database.

## Running the TimeHub app

### Creation of the Database

When a user logs in, a database connection is created and tables are created on this database.

### Tasks

The user defines a task with hours. The user may also provide this task with an optional description. A task may be assigned by the user to a project predefined by the user in the Project Overview tab. It is optional to assign a project to a task. However, statistics are only provided for **projects** with assigned tasks.

### Projects

The user has the option to create a list of projects. It is optional to record completed tasks under the classification of a project.

### Categories

The user also has the option to create a list of categories. It is optional to classify projects under the broader classification of a category.

## Statistics

A pie chart is provided to the user that displays proportional data of cumulative task hours according to the corresponding slice of pie for each **project**.
