# TimeHub
Timekeeping for personal and collaborative projects.

The focus for this app is tracking one-time, singular occurrences of completed tasks in order to calculate statistics for cumulative hours of tasks within different user-defined projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is necessary for the user to have access to a database with a MySQL relational database management system like MariaDB.

Login customization provided to the user to enter:

* Database Host (e.g., php.myadmin.ca)
* Database Codename
* Database User
* Database Password

This information can be reset from the File menu item: Change Database.

## Running the TimeHub app

### Creation of the Database

When a user logs in, a database connection is created and tables are created on this database.

## Statistics

A pie chart is provided to the user that displays proportional data of cumulative task hours according to the corresponding slice of pie for each project.
